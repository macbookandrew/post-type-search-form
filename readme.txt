Adds a shortcode for displaying post type-specific search forms

== Description ==
Adds a shortcode for displaying search forms including only a specified post type.

`[post_type_search_form post_type="your_post_type_here"]` will display a search form for only posts of the `your_post_type_here` type (modify as necessary). If you don’t know the post type key, go to the WordPress backend and add a new post of that type; look in the address bar for `post_type=…` and use that in the shortcode.

== Installation ==
1. Install the plugin
1. Add the shortcode where you want the search form to be shown
